<p>
    I am a musician, living in Berlin, since late 2013. After having endured work in entry level office jobs, bars and on one occation, dishwashing, I have decided since that it is time to step up
    and improve my skill set. This has led me to study coding on my own, in hopes of making it yet another avenue where I can develop and exercise my creativity.</p>
    
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I have worked on music ever since I arrived to the city. My skills as a songwriter and producer has improved ever since. I released a couple of EPs and a few singles as part of the band Strand Child.
        As of the moment I am focusing on putting out music under the artist name Hilding, preparing the release of an album late 2023.
