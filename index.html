    <h3>Introductory Statement</h3>
        <p>This is my first attempt at making a resume webpage, using html. As I keep improving my skills I will be able to 
            incorporate different projects that I will link to as I keep developing as a web designer. <p>I am a detail oriented team player who, through years of customer service experience, 
            have discovered I am capable of keeping customer interaction friendly on upbeat, with an ability to resolve conflict and find a suitable way forward when necessary.</p>
